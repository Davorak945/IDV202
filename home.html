Craft Art Gallery has recently expanded its exhibition space dramatically to allow for greater choice and to be considered a leader and one of the largest in Africa. We believe our customers are drawn to the gallery for its large variety of art displayed, and the ease we provide to our clients who prefer to buy online and the after sales service we offer all our clients.

In addition Cafe d'Art offers breakfasts, lunches and high teas. The area is well designed and equipped with a play area for children that will also be launching later this year. Customer framing needs can be attended to in our workshop where we also have a school of framing for the creatives who desire to do framing themselves.

We are very excited about Alice Art Gallery Online; it will offer full electronic commerce service with the best after sales service and advice possible with delivery worldwide. Although all the added services will enrich our customer experience our main focus is and always will be a satisfied client with both their purchase and the quality of experience during the process.
